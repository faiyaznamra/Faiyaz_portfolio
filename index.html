            <h2>Baby Web Developer</h2>
            <h3 class="orange-highlight">2019 - 2021 | Noob Level Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Every expert was once a beginner, and my journey as a web developer started right here. From 2019 to 2021, I was a noob-level developer, learning the ropes of HTML, CSS, and the basics of UI/UX design. It was a time of trial, error, and endless curiosity. I made mistakes, learned from them, and slowly but surely, began to understand the art of creating simple yet functional websites. Those early days taught me patience, resilience, and the importance of continuous learning. Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’ll always cherish this phase as the foundation of my growth.</p>
